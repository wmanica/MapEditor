#Map Editor - basic paint
Jun 2019

## Description
### // Short Intro
Challenge proposed by <Academia de Código_> bootcamp. A monochromatic paint with grid, graphics and persistence.
### // The Idea
The idea was to review everything learned up to that day. The goal was to create a grid and a brush that could paint or erase a cell. The position of the grid should be persisted to a single text file in order to be loaded again.
### // The Development
After deciding the main classes to be created and their responsibility, the first step was to create the grid. Then the brush was implemented, together with its movement and paint/erase actions. At last, saving and loading was implemented using Java.io.
As an extra mile implemented the possibility of using different colours with the brush as well as the possibility of persistence of this new different colours.
### // Tech && Methodologies
